## Summary

Introducing the Attachments and Files of Project.

## Basic Concept

### Files

Project consists of meta information and files.

In Raytemas Open API, there are many constraints in File Handling, which constitutes the Project.

Project Files must exist in the form that can be imported at any time in the first application/service.

In other words, APIs that directly modify / register Project Files have a lot of restrictions because they need to maintain compatible forms and specifications in Application / Service.

### Attachments

It refers to files managed in addition, separately from the file that directly consists of the Project.

Project ATTACHMENTS is free to register/modify.

If the Project Files is a component of the Project, the Project Attachments is an additional attachment.
